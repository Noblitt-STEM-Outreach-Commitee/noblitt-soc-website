## 1. General Information on the Organization

### 1.1 Overview

* The **Noblitt Scholars Program** at Rose-Hulman supports highly motivated, self-directed students—each class consisting of approximately 40 first-year students—selected through a competitive process aimed at fostering leadership and service in STEM ([Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology][1]).
* Within this program, the **Social Outreach Committee** (also styled as the Noblitt *STEM Outreach Committee*) focuses on expanding STEM access and enthusiasm to K-12 audiences.
* A recent profile notes that *Janaé Gillus*, a Noblitt Scholar and current sophomore, serves on the STEM Outreach Committee and organizes events such as lava lamp and tower-building activities, plus the annual STEM Jubilee ([Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology][2]).

### 1.2 Sub-Branches / Programs

* **STEM Jubilee**: A spring-quarter annual event filled with hands-on STEM activities for K-12 students ([Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology][2]).
* **Girl Scouts Program**: Engagement activities tailored to Girl Scouts (though no external reference, mention it as per your description).
* **School Partnerships**: Collaborative outreach with local schools (again, per your description).
* Other informal events: e.g., lava lamp and tower-building workshops ([Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology][2]).
